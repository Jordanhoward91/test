#UI Course Introduction
##Introduction to User Interface and Design For Developers

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: Hi and welcome to this course on user interface for developers. My name is Jordan
Hudgens. And with me is Jesse Cook the CEO and creative director for the slate development shop.
If you followed along in our user experience course that is where we helped you develop a system for
all of the steps needed for building a clean and efficient user interface. And that is a very important
component on building an application build whether it be mobile desktop or any type of software
system.
Now, in this course, we’re going to take that knowledge and we’re going to extend it into the parts of
the system where the users are actually going to be able to see it. So this is everything from colors,
white space, all kinds of different components. And one of the reasons why I was very excited about
this course is because this is a topic I personally want to learn.
Part of the reason we’re building the course and why Jesse is coming down is this is not a personal
strength for me, which is the reason why Jesse is here we want somebody that is specialized has
been doing this for years and has had quite a bit of success in implementing these type of techniques.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: Yeah. What we really want to talk about is to give you guys the best fundamentals to
give you guys that low hanging fruit that’s going to really push your ability to design something
yourself and not only just design it but also understand the principles that any creative is being
delivered to you with so that you can understand how to implement those designs in a pixel-perfect
fashion. So really understanding the thought process that goes behind the typography choices that
goes behind the colors the style guide the balance on the page the better grasp you guys have on
understanding those design principles will not only make you more capable of designing these things
yourself but they’re also going to make you a lot better of a developer because you’re going to be
able to implement designs that are given to you a lot more confidently.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: Absolutely. And just before we were filming we’re talking about one of the developers that
works for Slate who also is very good at design. And you’re talking about how with that set of skill
that combination it has made every project he’s work on just turn out very well.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: Yeah, he showed a huge interest in really stepping more into the design realm. You know we
hired him on as a developer and he really showed that he wanted to take a proactive approach to
learning the creative direction part. And he’s just been flourishing and it’s been awesome. Not only
has he been having a great time like really being able to expand his skill set but the other developers
have talked to me. And on the projects that they’ve worked with him, it’s been so smooth because
he’s been able to design and understand what that looks like on the development side. And since he’s
the one that’s also implementing a lot of the front end communicating with the back end everything
UI Course Introduction 2
is just going so smoothly because they don’t have to build a bridge to anyone because he’s already
there.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: Absolutely that’s something that for my own side one thing that I personally am trying to
improve on myself is in this exact skill because the workflow that I’ve had for the majority of my
own career has been working with somebody like yourself and I would always have to wait until I
got the mockups the designs everything like that. And it always made it so I was constantly waiting
for these things. For these screens and these designs to be done. And if I could personally be better
on this side of the design and that part of it then that could help make me a better developer because
1) I would know what’s going on and the thought processes behind picking out certain styles and
how you design different components. But also I’d be able to do that and go right into development
and make the entire process much more efficient.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: Yeah, absolutely it’s definitely something where you shouldn’t be terrified of design and think
oh I don’t have any design in my in my jeans so I’m not ever going to be able to be a designer. There’s
a lot of very basic fundamentals that if you understand those and really practice those and take an
active approach to learning how to better implement typography in color and white space it’s going
to put you so much farther forward in your ability to design it. Learning those fundamentals gives
you the foundation on which you can really start to actively get better as opposed to just kind of
spinning around in circles and designing the same type of stuff and so what we’re going to do is
we’re going to really lay that foundation of what you should be thinking about why it’s important.
There are some things that maybe you think don’t carry as much weight in actually why it looks
the way it does and you just say “Man, I don’t know why this doesn’t look great but it just doesn’t
look great”. So we want to kind of give you some insight as to maybe why it doesn’t look and what
you could do to make it look better.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: Absolutely. This is, a course, I’m very excited about it. I hope that you get as much from it as I
do. And we will see you in the next set of guides.
How to Create a System for Design Inspiration

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: Hi, and welcome to our guide on inspiration as it applies to a user interface. This
is a really important part of the course because as I’ve gone through other user interface courses and
I’ve tried to learn to see what types of things are important to teach but also to learn. This seemed
to be a very critical component that seemed to be missing. And so that’s why we’re going into it
right away and it’s because whenever I’ve tried to design anything whether it’s a Web site or a logo
or anything like that. One of the hardest steps I have is that first one which is I’ve no idea what to
actually design and when I will speak with a number of other designers they kind of almost skip
over that part a little bit. And to me without that you really can’t do anything else. And so I wanted
to talk with you and get kind of what your personal system is for getting inspiration. So when I say
I need feature X Y Z on devcamp1 how do you know that it should be this box with these kinds of
rounded edges and where do you place all the components and just kind of talk to how you get those
kinds of ideas for the projects you work on.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: Right. Absolutely, this is something that I find a lot of designers are kind of hesitant to
talk about sometimes not with other designers but maybe in a situation like this because it’s almost
like you know you’re giving away a little bit of the “secret sauce”. The concept of looking to other
work for inspiration is crucial. There’s no reason why that’s how we are getting better at our design
than we’re iterating and our design is changing, the way apps look today are different than they
looked three years ago. And they’re going to look different three years from now, and everyone is
kind of, you know developing and we moved from let’s go back in time six years everything was
using what’s called skew morphic design.
If you think of the original iPhone iOS. The notes had the kind of fake leather right over the top you
know. Everything looked like it was a digital rendition of a physical item. And so the shading, drop
shadow, everything was like really like pseudo-realistic right. And that’s called skew morphism.
All of a sudden that became really outdated. It was iOS 7 when all of a sudden it went totally flat.
Like hardly any drop shadows. Everything was flat colors hardly any gradients and there was really
jarring for a lot of people outside the design community because inside the design community we
already been seeing that happen. We’d been seeing Websites doing that and so then IOS did it and
the world was like I don’t like this.
The reason why Steve Jobs wanted the scheme morphic designed first is because people were not
used to working on a smartphone. So he wanted a lot of elements of the real world on it. So at least
people would feel a little bit safer kind of making that jump into the digital realm. The reason I bring
these things up is because design is always changing and it’s going to start communicating to the
public in different ways. We didn’t know how to scroll really well when Web sites first came out.
Everyone is shoving all the content above the fold they were putting it in the first 900 pixels because
that’s how they did it with newspapers. Right. Newspapers you put all the big stories up on there.
And so when we invented Web site it’s like oh this is just kind of a newspaper on a computer. So
that’s what people try to do and if you go back in 1998 Website is just got all the things like up before
you scroll.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: Absolutely.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png):

And then you know we’ve now hit 2010. People figured out that you can scroll and then you start
seeing a lot more landing pages come up where you can tell a story you know section by section by
section. Design continues to change, so you need to be able to go out see what apps are looking like
see what Web sites are looking like. So the first thing that I do there’s two really popular Web sites
where designers publish their work. They publish it one day to kind of build a following and you
know it’s like Instagram but just for designs or others there’s bēhance2
and there’s dribble3
.
They’re both really great. I just bounce back and forth between the both of them. You’re not
necessarily going there to say “I’m going to go and completely mimic another design”. Odds are
no one’s really designed the exact application that you’re doing. Maybe sometimes they have and
there’s nothing wrong with looking at those and be like oh that’s interesting they put those settings
in this way or they took this action in this way that’s totally fine. Sometimes there’s an objective

UI Course Introduction 4
right answer or way to do something and I’ve hit things or I’m just like this is the only right way to
do this. But then there’s a lot of subjectivity in design and so you definitely can kind of pivot and be
like I love most of what they did here but there’s a few things that they could have done differently.
From a strictly aesthetic perspective, you’re going in and you’re looking at you know what kind of
color palette are these people using. You don’t need to reinvent the wheel for a lot of these things
so if I’m designing an application and the application has a list with profile photos on the left and
some metadata on the right.
Do you know how many times that’s been designed? Like just an index of objects.
So many times. So go and look and be like OK do I go a really strong and dark name like username
and then like a light colored thin font off to the right. Or do I make them both thin or do I make
this blue so that I know that I can click it. So there’s a lot of different decisions you can make. As
opposed to saying this is the only way that you’re going to do this going forward.
No, it’s about the process. So the first thing you should do when you know the type of things that
need design you’ve already gotten through the user experience a lot of times this helps in the user
experience as well. Like forgot password. Can you immediately think of all the screens that need to
exist for a Forgot Password? Do you click and then it says an e-mail link is on the way or does it
say Hey we just texted you a code and here is this. What’s that exact process? Go grab your phone,
log out of Facebook and then click forgot password and see how they do it. See how all these other
apps are doing it. Because then you’re getting really good user experience right there. “Oh, that’s a
huge pain I had to open my mail on my phone or on my desktop. No, I like the text version better”.
It’s such a benefit don’t ignore that, to be able to test things out and that’ll just help you kind of get
forward and you’re not. I mean that’s just the right way to do it.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: Absolutely, and with that when you know the application you’re building and the feature set
that’s definitely one part of it. Do you find that when you are not actually going and you don’t have
a specific project in mind do you still just to continually learn and find new things? Are you still
going to those websites just to look out of curiosity?

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: Yeah it’s like Instagram right.? It’s like a social network, and even more so you know I have a
bookmark folder, and whenever I’m on any website and I like something that they did I’ll bookmark
it. I’m like. “Oh man, I really like how they showed this testimonial”. The next time I’m designing
the Web site I’m going to come and look at this testimonial, right? So I’m always saving stuff that I
like. I take pictures of patterns I like out in the real world just like oh this could be a cool background
pattern. Definitely, when I see apps that I really like the design, a perfect example is Venmo versus
the cash app, by Square. Two very different interfaces. And personally I just love the cash app and
so I use it because that’s the design I like. But you can compare that and you can be like OK you
know Venmo is going for this and cash is going for this.
Why? They obviously maybe made a decision of why to do this type of design and why they did this
type of design. You’re just constantly adding to that mental portfolio especially because a big tool
you have to solve problems both in user experience but also definitely in user interface is precedence.
Whenever you hit a point it’s so helpful if you have a problem like “How am I going to design that?”
UI Course Introduction 5
if you’ve just got something logged in your head. It’s just like oh I know snap chat does something
like this.
And you can go to that and you can look at the precedents and you can see if that worked well or
worked poorly. It gives you just like such a foothold and you’re not just like spinning your tires all
the time.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: That’s huge. That’s one of the biggest points on why I wanted to include this guide in the entire
course and to me this is actually one of the most important things that everyone will take away
from the course because I personally feel especially when I was younger and I was really struggling
with coming up with design ideas because there would be so many times I’d be the only developer
on a project which I did do everything, not just the web application but also the logo and the color
scheme and everything.
I always had this mindset that I needed in order to build a good design it all needed to be done from
scratch. It had to be a one of a kind. I couldn’t look at anything else. This had to be just something
that came out of nothing.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: Yeah.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: And that never turned out well.
You know we haven’t even talked about that. You know there are the apples of the world and those
types of people. They have a lot of thought processes and they spent tens of millions of dollars in
researching what makes a good user interface and to simply ignore that is irresponsible.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: it really is.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: learning from all of the work that’s been done by people who’ve been doing this for a very long
time. That’s a very critical component of it. And if we skip past that we’re constantly going to be
running into the same problems over and over again where we just kind of get stuck and can’t really
build something that feels professional.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: Right, take for example Snapchat, and then all of a sudden Facebook comes out with a very
similar feature on Instagram and then adds that live streaming to its Facebook platform or the live
streaming on Facebook, compare that to Meerkat or periscope things like that. They look extremely
similar. Why? Because there’s a lot of objectively correct ways to do things in there. It’s like they’re
going to look really similar because to make it look different would just make it worse. There’s
just certain things, think about whether we just have hearts come up underneath or do we have
comments that also come up underneath.
If you look at Facebook live streaming and Periscope it’s really close. Facebook has come over from
the right and Periscope had them come up from underneath. It’s so nuanced and close but it’s like
how else are you supposed to do it. There’s nothing wrong with looking at how other people are
doing it and then making a decision is that the right way. Is that the wrong way. Is there a subjectively
different way that could be just as good? Yeah! But if you’re not even looking at it because you’re
scared that you may be copying something then you’re doing yourself a huge disservice.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: I think that is 100% accurate. Some homework for you as students going through this is before
you even go on to the next guide. I definitely recommend for you to go to a few of those applications
UI Course Introduction 6
like dribble4
and be hands-on with these so that you can start to see what’s out there. When Jessie
originally showed those to me because that was not really the part of the world I dove into. I was
absolutely fascinated. It was like all of these different screens and concepts of the very talented
designers are coming up with, those are things I could learn from and those are things that like you
said you can develop that mental portfolio those things that whenever I start to think about a new
feature or some new page that I need to create all of a sudden I’m not starting from scratch I’m able
to leverage what I’ve learned from others especially others that have been doing that for a very long
time.
Have fun looking at those sites and we’ll see you in the next guide.
Strategies for Building a UI Color Scheme

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: As we continue on in this section on the elements of design for user interfaces
in this guide we’re going to talk about colors and how we can use colors how we can pick them
out and we’re also going to get into some very practical sides on when we’ve had a few examples
where the color was more than just something that looked pretty color actually determined parts
of the user experience and how we have. And this is why I think this is a very important guide is
there is still a little bit I think of a mindset in many developers and just people in general that think
designers make things look pretty. And that’s what they do. And that’s really all that there is to UI.
But for our case study, we’re going to go through. You’ll see that color determined the entire feeling
that people had as they started going through this application. So it affected the user experience the
business and how it looked.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: Yeah. I love color, I think it’s so fun to pick what colors I would use in an app. I
really wanted to get a client who would let me design something completely purple. I haven’t done
something all purple.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: You weren’t hired by Yahoo?

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: I really love being able to plan out my whole color scheme for the app. When you’re doing that
you’re going to be thinking of a few things. It’s not necessarily just like oh well I like this color so
I’m going to pick it. You have the branding of that company or that product, or that specific project
that you need to consider. You need to know how that color is going to behave in every aspect. A
perfect example is on Devcamp, where were using a green color and it’s kind of a lighter color of
green. We were seeing that any time that that color was a highlight color in text just text. It’s really
hard to see. It was really hard when it was on white it was just really hard to pick that that green
off. So we had to have another darker color green and a part of the style guide was hey any text
when it goes green it needs to be this darker color or this darker shade than our branding of green.
So you’re thinking of more than just oh this looks good. It’s how is this going to be used? Sometimes
I really like a lot of really subtle whites and grays. I don’t like really deep contrasts like 1995 style
like really like deep contrasts between the whites and the grays. However, I’m working on a really
nice monitor maybe not everyone will be

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: right

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: Bad monitors are really bad at separating like an f7f7f7 Gray from just a pure white. And they
see them both as white and you’ll see that on projectors too.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: Yeah

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: That’s why I make sure when I’m showing clients I like showing them on my monitor, not a
projector because it just looks like I just made an all white app.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: Projectors make for some very bad types of demos for clients.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: Yeah, exactly
You’re thinking about a lot more than just necessarily what makes it look pretty. A really good
tool for planning out your color scheme and we’ll put the Web site in and of course materials. But
Paletton5
it’s a great Website where you can go in. You can put in a hex value and it’ll give you
lighter and darker shades all inside of that same like color family. It also shows you different shades
or different colors complimentary things like that that you can use. A very common mistake that I
see a lot of developers make when they’re coding a button say they have a green button and then
they have an on hover color. And that on hover green it’s a different hue, a different shade is fine.
But it’s a more saturated green. So you’ve got this lime green going to a forest green and it just looks
horrible. I go there every time. I never just arbitrarily pick a darker shade.
I’d go to Paletton and I get all my lighter and darker shades so I’ll use a lighter shade for maybe
an inactive button and then the main shade for when it’s active and then a darker shade for when
it’s hovered right so you really want to have this strategy throughout the app. These are the hovers
these are the inactive states. These are the main colors. And here we’re going to use mostly green
but then occasionally we’re going to bring in a red or blue in very specific instances or maybe you’re
an app that’s going to be using both and at the same time.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: One example kind of going back to making sure everything’s pixel perfect. The one time with
Devcamp I was building out a screen that you had sent over and it had a button and everything
matched except when I started using it something just felt a little bit different. And you the one that
caught it and it turned out that the border of the button was just slightly different. And that’s what
threw it off. We’re talking literally about a 1-pixel border. And it wasn’t even horrible it just threw
it off and it made it feel not quite right.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: it was fuzzy.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: Just another example of how detailed it is and how important that is.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: Don’t get mad at your designers if they’re being really nitpicky over stuff like that because it
makes a big difference

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: It really does.
Just so you understand the process that when I’m working on a project with the Jesse he’ll send over
the screens I will go implement them. Then as soon as I feel like they match from what I see I send
5
paletton.com
UI Course Introduction 8
it back to Jesse for a two-way process and he goes through and then sends notes. I never get upset
when Jesse sends me notes back saying nope, nope, nope. These things have to be fixed because
it does make a significant difference and on a first pass my eye may not pick those things up but
you’re the one that built that design so you realized right away where the issue was. And that makes
a huge difference.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: Oh yeah.
A lot of times its not even necessarily things that I picked up from the beginning and then once I
actually see it in use and I can hover over things and start to see how things actually work. All of a
sudden it’s like whoa, my strategy was wrong.
I remember this one time I was actually at the gym and you called me and we had just implemented
a screen that shows who you’re following on daily smarty and all the buttons of who you were
following. So we’re looking at buttons and it’s like I want to follow someone so on hover goes
blue you click it. Well now, what does the button do? After you’ve clicked the follow where does
the unfollow button come from what does that look like? Originally we made the button red to
unfollow it to differentiate it from the other follow buttons. But there was something really weird
and we were looking at it and there’s something both of us don’t like about this screen

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: right.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: But we didn’t know what it was and what we realized was that what it’s doing, and this is it
shows the power of color, what it was doing is that all the people you were following had this big
red gross thing next to them and it just felt negative.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: Right.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: But these are the people you’re following these are the people you like most on this platform and
they have this big like angry red button right next to them and it just didn’t feel right even though
it was very functional that you’re like “Oh, I know where to go to click unfollow that person.” But
it just didn’t make you feel good about looking at the people that you were following.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: Right.
That’s such an important thing with color, red for one example, is something that is usually only
used to signal that something bad happened. It usually is that an error happened on the page, or the
form you submitted didn’t have the information that is needed and you need to go fix it. So typically
red has that negative connotation in people’s minds. And what I really liked was for the dailysmarty
example after we had that conversation Jesse recommended that we go and we start looking at how
other people were doing it. So going back to one of our first guides when we talked about getting
inspiration. The inspiration doesn’t just happen in the beginning it also goes along at each stage of
that development lifecycle.
We went and we looked at Instagram and we’re like does Instagram turn the button red? No, in
fact when you press follow. It automatically changes it to white and then allows you to message
the person so there’s not that negative kind of connotation when you’re seeing your friends. Now
old versions of Twitter used to have that same unfollow you’d click on follow it instantly turned
the button red and then Twitter changed that eventually maybe for the same exact reasons why we
UI Course Introduction 9
changed it and that’s a great example it’s just a great case study for showing the importance of color
in an application.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jesse.png)

: Right, and it shows how user interface kind of interplays with user experience. Because you
are thinking of a couple of things at that point we have to ask ourselves the question. Well okay,
so Instagram they don’t like leaving a bunch of unfollow buttons because they don’t want people
gaming the system and they don’t want people going and just unfollow, unfollow, unfollow. They
want to bury the button. I always am worried about talking about specific interface things. Is that by
the time people watch it because it might have changed but you have like go to the person’s profile
and you have to unfollow. And so we have to ask ourselves do we want to purposely make it more
difficult to unfollow people in mass no or maybe until we hit a certain critical mass. Let’s just make
it as easy to use as possible so once you click follow maybe it goes blue with solid and then it says
unfollow. It just changes the words but it doesn’t go red to connotate something bad.

{width: 8, float: left}
![](jordan.png)

: Absolutely, and that’s really one of the main takeaways that I want you to get from this specific
guide is that colors are much more than just some kind of palette on the screen. They are something
that can help dictate that user experience and change the way that your users interact with the
system. So I definitely recommend for you to go and check out some popular applications and note
some of the different types of color schemes and palettes that they use. See how they use similar
colors for things like you mentioned like for buttons and button hover effects and see the way they
create that kind of combination. And then we’ll see you in the next guide.
